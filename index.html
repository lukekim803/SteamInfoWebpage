       This webpage will showcase Valve's Steam Platform in order to understand its algorithmic patterns.
       The pages will just point out what exists within the platform such as their marketplace and Community Forums.
        It will overlook through Steam's techno political issues and how they run their data through their platform.
        On this webpage there are buttons that will take you to different webpages that will show users these things.
        There is also a short <a href="page2.html">system</a> built into the webpage that will give users a selected game based on the type of 
        genre and style of game they choose. Steam also uses their own, "Steam Cloud," to store data from the games you played automatically. This allows users to retrieve
        data through different devices.
